<p>I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016, and have worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup <a href="https://www.addepar.com">Addepar</a> ever since. Starting Fall 2020, I&rsquo;ll be at Princeton pursuing a Master&rsquo;s in Computer Science.</p>
<p>My interests run the gamut of computer science and its applications. They include the development of safe and fair artificial intelligence, the analysis and design of algorithms, and the application of both to issues of public health and environmental management. I specifically hope to use my coming time in graduate school to research machine learning interpretability and to explore ways to contribute to infectious disease research and prevention.</p>
<p>Outside of work, I read many books, watch a lot of anime, and play a ton of Starcraft. I also like to draw, as this webpage&rsquo;s subtitle hints. That instagram account I&rsquo;ve linked to hasn&rsquo;t been updated in a while, but that will hopefully have changed by the time you&rsquo;re reading this.</p>
