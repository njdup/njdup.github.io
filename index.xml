      <description>No one on the news had any idea how to cover it. No neighborhood reporter or Pulitzer Prize winning journalist. No local, national, or international program.

      <description>I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. I&amp;rsquo;m now at Princeton pursuing a Master&amp;rsquo;s in Computer Science.
This website serves as a home for my writing ✍️, which ranges from sci-fi and magical realist fiction to long-form social and political commentary. I want to tell good stories and agitate for change.</description>
