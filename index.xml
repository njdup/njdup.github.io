      <description>No one on the news had any idea how to cover it. Not a single neighborhood reporter or Pulitzer Prize winning journalist. Nor any local, national, or international program. Watching the news anchors try to piece it together was almost funny. As they listened to experts in multiverse theory lay out long-winded analogies, their wrinkled foreheads betrayed the exhausting mental gymnastics unfoldi in their minds.
‚ÄúSo, what you‚Äôre saying is, the very fabric of our world is being absorbed into theirs?</description>

      <description>Hello üëã I&amp;rsquo;m Nick Dupoux.
I graduated from Stanford with a B.S. in Computer Science in 2016 and worked as a software engineer at the financial technology startup Addepar until late 2020. I&amp;rsquo;m taking time off now to selfishly indulge my art practice.
This website serves as a home for my writing ‚úçÔ∏è, which ranges from sci-fi and magical realist short stories to technical blog posts to commentary on whatever&amp;rsquo;s most recently drawn my attention.</description>
