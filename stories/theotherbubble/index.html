			<p>No one on the news had any idea how to cover it. No neighborhood reporter or Pulitzer Prize winning journalist. No local, national, or international program. Watching the news anchors try to piece it all together was almost funny. As experts on multiverse theory laid out long-winded analogies, their wrinkled foreheads betrayed the mental gymnastics being performed by their minds.</p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is, the very fabric of our world is being absorbed into theirs?”</p>
<p>“Not exactly, no,” replied today&rsquo;s guest, a middle-aged woman who had apparently made a name for herself in the Physics community back in the 1990s. She tapped the ballpoint pen in her left hand against the news desk after delivering about every third or fourth sentence, visibly annoying her interviewer. “It’s less absorbing and more… colliding.” <em>Tap</em>.</p>
<p>“Colliding?” The anchor shot an exasperated glance at her pen.</p>
<p>“Yes, colliding. Think of it like a car accident. One car doesn’t really absorb the other, even if it becomes lodged inside the vehicle’s frame or whatever. They collide. And sometimes they explode, and whatever materials made up those cars are incinerated, transformed, altered, and cast out this way and that. Then no matter where he shards of charred steel or aluminum end up, they can be collected and used to make something else again. Maybe another car. Or something new entirely.”</p>
<p>“We’re all going to end up incinerated, then?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that is probably how this will all end.”</p>
<p>The anchor leaned back in his chair. &ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve been reporting over the last few weeks that there&rsquo;s been quite the fracture in your scientific community over how this mess will actually end. Not everyone is convinced that it&rsquo;ll be some grand explosion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The woman nodded. &ldquo;That is true. And I respect my peers who are starting to think that. But I still hold strong to the belief that this won&rsquo;t end in some sort of merging of the two realities, but instead in visceral destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea when?”</p>
<p>“Not very concretely, no. We&rsquo;re still working out the calculations. We thought we had it last week, actually, but when we plugged the result back in to verify it, we got the wrong value solving for Planck&rsquo;s Constant.&rdquo; The woman shook her head. Her streaks of grey hair carved an arc through the air like neon gas burning in a sign. “But I’d place good money on the fact that time IS limited&hellip;”</p>
<p>Gracie turned off the TV. The news anchor flashed out of existence with pursed lips and his head hung low.</p>
<p>“Watching this shit is pointless.”</p>
<p>“This shit? What do you mean?” Henry replied, taking a sip of his coffee. No matter the state of the universe, work waited in forty-five minutes. He was a cop, after all, one of the only professions that never lost its need to report to duty, even as everything crumbled. Order needed to be maintained, up to the end. Or, rather, <em>property</em> still needed protecting. So, the need to be caffeinated and ready for his shift remained.</p>
<p>“What I mean is, they’ve said the same thing over and over. We get it.” Gracie returned to washing the morning’s dirty dishes in the kitchen sink, scrubbing more vigorously than before Henry had turned on the flat-screen and the 7 AM New York local news.</p>
<p>“Do we? Do you understand what’s going on?”</p>
<p>“For Christ’s sake, of course not. And that’s my point. We get that we don’t get it. No one does. I mean, they’ve tried explaining it in so many different ways.” Gracie pulled her soap sud covered hands from the sink. “Our universe is a bubble and it’s colliding with another universe bubble. And when the tension between us becomes too much, it might go pop!” She aggressively motioned air quotes at each “bubble” and emphasized the “pop” with a quick thrust of her fingers. Her last motion sent a few soap bubbles floating out in all directions around her. Spotting the largest one, she followed its path through the air with her finger. It rose a few inches before lingering at about her eye level. With a swift finger jab, the bubble ruptured and burst. A few soap streaks landed in Henry’s coffee, set on the counter close to Gracie. He soon took another sip, anyway. He liked his coffee black, so it already tasted as bitter as it could get.</p>
<p>“Do you think the bubble analogy can explain why we can see them, but they can’t see us?” he asked, wiping away a few coffee drops that were stuck to the hairs of his black mustache and beard.</p>
<p>“I don’t know…” said Gracie, returning to her scrubbing. “Maybe they should be able to see us, but they’re all blind?”</p>
<p>“But they’ve shown up at movies and art galleries. We saw them at the Guggenheim, admiring the pieces with their eyes. Why would those places even exist for them, too, exactly as they do for us, if they were all blind?” She turned away from him as he spoke, her pale cheeks flushed pink and her eyes cast low. Henry walked behind her and planted a kiss on the back of her neck, right below the baseline of her red hair. “It wasn’t dumb. It was just a thought.”</p>
<p>She glanced over her shoulder, giving him an opportunity to look into her eyes. He wondered if his days looking into their particular shade of hazelnut were still numbered. The fear triggered by the early days of the phenomenon, a long three months ago, still lingered in his stomach. The images of the chaos, riots, crime, dissolution of governments, burning, societal breakdown, mass suicides, still floated around his mind. But also the images of a slow settling into the current status quo, life almost returning to normal. Governments re-establishing control. People returning to work. The world felt suspended in an uneasy sense of peace now that what had seemed to be inevitable and rapidly approaching had become uncertain and drawn out. Some scientists were now saying that the end might actually not come to pass. And their words spread as power was gradually restored, newspapers delivered again with increasing frequency, and television broadcasts re-entered airwaves. And he, along with many, were beginning to think that maybe they actually would all be alright. Maybe they all wouldn&rsquo;t die after all.</p>
<p>But, still, they probably would.</p>
<p>Gracie turned away, wiped her eyes, and returned to scrubbing the dishes. The one at hand was a decorative wine glass from a cheap Midtown East bar. They’d rung in the new year in it surrounded by the few friends they still had in the city. The ones that hadn’t moved away to raise families in more hospitable environments. The words “Happy 2020th Birthday to the World!” were etched across the glass in large obnoxious font. She refused to drink out of any other glass. It was the dumbest thing they owned.</p>
<p>Henry gathered his half full coffee mug from the counter and placed it into the sink for his girlfriend to wash. As he passed her on his way to the coat rack, he gave her shoulders a short, tender thank you squeeze. Gracie tensed up slightly at his initial touch, but relaxed as she registered the lightness of his grip.</p>
<p>“Hey, before you go…” she started as Henry pulled on his coat and reached for the door. Turning around, he took in how she looked leaning across the kitchen counter and wiping her hands on a dishcloth. He still remembered how he felt the first time he&rsquo;d seen her. The way her black dress clung to her short body, its fabric locked in step with the twists and turns of her skin like a loving dance partner. He was pulled to her, her beauty the point of mass, his lust the gravitational force. That force had been so strong then. Unable to be resisted. It felt distinctly weaker today.</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Have you still not found yourself out there?”</p>
<p>“Nope. Have you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… I have. I found me yesterday.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Her eyes glanced towards the open bedroom door on the far side of their small apartment. &ldquo;At the supermarket.” She ran her hand through her hair. “It looked like I never left my punk rock phase.”</p>
<p>Henry smiled. “I should go. Have a nice day.”</p>
<p>And with that, he put on his hat and stepped through the door.</p>
<p>When she was sure he was out of the building, the echo of his footsteps fully faded into the surrounding city, Gracie sat down on the living room couch, turned back on the TV, and stared, expectantly, at the bedroom door.</p>
<hr>
<p>Henry had traveled only a couple of blocks when the Event began. It started exactly as always. First, the light all around him began to wobble, as if he were peering at a shape far in the distance at the end of a hot asphalt road. Soon after, the colors of the objects around him began fluctuating wildly. The black Toyota Prius parallel parked next to him shifted to a light mint green, a staggering red, and settled on a bright purple, almost fuchsia. The trees in the park to his left shifted to a brilliant orange, their leaves shining with a bright yellow, like a star going supernova.</p>
<p>Then came the the sound of footsteps, and the growing hum of conversations happening all around him. His fellow pedestrians walking down 2nd Avenue had all stopped to observe, in apprehensive silence, the transition into this new, peculiar reality. The sounds did not come from them. After another minute, the figures appeared. All dressed in the street garb of average New Yorkers. All standing at everyday heights, walking with normal postures, talking with unexceptional voices. All ordinarily human. The only thing that differentiated them was the translucent quality of their bodies. Light traveled through them as if they were simultaneously there and not there, physically present before you but existing on some other plane of existence entirely.</p>
<p>The real — only in a sense, of course, since the Others were supposedly real in their own way — New Yorkers slowly returned to their daily business. Henry had early on noted that the most remarkable quality of the Events was the cloud of unspoken dread it brought with them. That effect was strong today, as men, women, and children all along the avenue sulked about, each unsure how to fully continue their lives with the Others around. One woman in front of him, who had only moments earlier been walking at quite a quick jaunt, was now lumbering along, dragging her feet along the ground, like she suddenly didn’t remember where she was going. Wherever it was, she now felt no sense of urfency to get there. The destination didn&rsquo;t matter anymore, not when compared to the new normal settling in all around them. Henry took the opportunity to pass her. He continued his commute, his chest puffed out, determined to remain normal in the face of the absurdity.</p>
<p>Shuffling past three or four more consternated individuals, Henry quickly arrived at the highlight of his morning commute: the daily detour to a dingy coffee shop on the corner of 15th street. The sign above its entrance had once spelled out &ldquo;Steadyman Espresso,&rdquo; but some of its letters had been ripped down over the course of the early days’ rioting. It now read &ldquo;Steady pro&rdquo; — ignoring the gap between the r and o — which Henry thought was a much more fitting name. A clear improvement. He had never even noticed the shop before the  Events began, but sometime during the first week of the chaos, he&rsquo;d caught sight of the place while thinking about what sections of the city would be the hotbeds of civil unrest that day. Through the window he noticed a lone, late twenty-something man sitting behind the counter. He wore a sharp white button-down and tie partially hidden by a black apron. No one else was in there with him, but he looked alert, like he was ready to jump behind the espresso machine and whisk up a cappuccino at a moment&rsquo;s notice. Henry immediately knew the man was his kind of person. Dedicated to his work, the disintegration of the world be damned.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s diligence was made even more impressive by the conditions of the shop around him. It seemed that it occupied the same space as a meat processing plant in the Others&rsquo; universe. Half translucent slabs of beef hung on the walls and over the shop&rsquo;s mahogany wood tables. As many had tragically learned during the first few Events, tripping into oncoming traffic while following a Other into a taxicab or falling onto the subway tracks while boarding what they thought was an arriving train in their own reality, what existed in the Other’s physical realm didn’t necessarily exist in their own, and vice versa. So the droplets of blood that dripped from the carcasses passed right through the tables, and pooled in large, reddish-brown puddles underneath them. Now, even as society uneasily settled back into routine, the shop remained empty, as most would understandably prefer not to be reminded of the inevitability of death as they sip on their morning pick-me-ups. But it was still open, and Henry was drawn to it and that man behind the counter.</p>
<p>When he walked in today, the man stood ready with the usual cup of pure black roast. He handed it over with a curt nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll be thirty thousand ninety five hundred, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Henry, prepared for the latest round of inflation after pawning his dearly departed mother&rsquo;s jewelry over the weekend, handed him five fresh ten thousand dollar bills. &ldquo;Keep the change, as always,&rdquo; he said, already halfway out the door. He paused outside the shop, brought the coffee to his nose, and took in a deep breath. He savored its aroma, strong like a burning forest.</p>
<p>The comfort of his cherished, stable routine evaporated shortly after. Standing across the street from the coffee shop, on the other side of 14th street, was himself, patiently waiting for traffic to clear. The neatly combed black hair, the thick beard, and the thin wire frame glasses were impossible to mistake. He knew those features intimately. They were his own. Henry stood, his mouth involuntarily ajar, and stared forward at himself. He had been wondering when this moment would arrive, and here it was, and he had wondered what it would feel like, and the feeling was unlike any he had ever felt. It was a sense of awe and bewilderment. A sense that he was staring at the most crisp reflection of himself imaginable, but a reflection that was off in small ways. So small, yet absolutely jarring. Other Henry wore a short sleeve baseball tee, which left his forearms exposed. And on one was a tattoo. A brilliant apple blossom with rays of sunlight emanating from it. The sun at the center of the galaxy. Henry would never tarnish his skin with an image like that.</p>
<p>Once the Other traffic cleared, Other Henry hurried across the street, walking toward him. He quickly passed, his face buried in his phone. Henry took note of his counterpart’s carelessness, how he was not one to look where he was going. In his own world, he was an evangelist for attentiveness, quick to chastise Gracie for her tendency to check her phone the exact moment a notification arrived, regardless of whether she was walking across the street, sitting comfortably at home, riding a bike, or operating heavy machinery. He had even ripped the phone out of her hands one evening in a moment of raw anger when she checked it at the dinner table. Gracie’s wounded stare had torn him apart as savagely as a hawk ripping at a dead fox’s body. He vowed to never lash out in such a way again. Unfortunately, a similar altercation occurred four days later.</p>
<p>Now, faced with a moment of truth, Henry felt his natural wariness taking hold. Would he follow him, or move on with his day, forever left to wonder how life had panned out for himself in this parallel world? He took a step forward onto the street, almost ready to resist the temptation. But then turned around, stepped back onto the sidewalk, and followed Other Henry up 2nd Avenue.	Other Henry walked a direct, uninterrupted path up the avenue, past parks and schoolyards, busy bodegas and bustling subway entrances, until he hit 23rd Street, where he made a left turn and walked west. That turn confirmed what Henry had suspected from the moment he’d started following the doppelgänger: he was heading towards Henry’s old apartment, the one he had fled years ago. Henry slowed down his pace, took off his coat, and fanned his sweaty back with his shirt. This September morning wasn’t as balmy as any in August or July, but dressed in a well-fitted suit — the kind the Chief demanded all officers wear when not in uniform to convey a sense of professionalism — it was hot. He considered turning around, and continuing on to work. He’d certainly be late now, but the Chief wouldn’t mind. At least he wouldn’t be yet another no show, another grunt shrugging off his duties in the face of The End. 		But he’d come this far. He might as well see what he wanted to see. Picking back up his pace, he caught up with Other Henry, who now stood in front of the red brick, six story building Henry had once called home. He keyed in the entry code, still remembered by heart, at the doorside buzzer while his Other used a key to open it and walk through. Once through the front door, it was a brisk walk up two flights of stairs before reaching the door to the old apartment. Number 2C. Other Henry had already made his way inside. Henry steadied his resolve. Walking into a stranger’s apartment like this was odd, without a doubt, but technically, he was walking around in the apartment already. Wouldn’t anyone understand his curiosity? The need to observe his Other live a life that could have been his own? With that thought in mind, he knocked on the door, hoping that the current residents were home. No answer. He proceeded to plan B, then. He searched for the brick with the old paint mark shaped like the Big Dipper, somewhere at the bottom right of the door frame. Once found, he discovered it was still loose, and after removing the brick, a spare key glistened in wait. The Landlord still told all her residents about that trick. Henry took the key and gingerly inserted it into the keyhole.</p>
<p>The door opened directly into the living room, laid out roughly as he’d left it, the landlord provided furnishings put to good use by its current residents. His Other was seated on the worn leather couch, his feet propped up on the sandalwood coffee table. He swung them from side to side as he looked across the room with a smile. Henry followed his eyes. He could almost feel his heart beating in his throat.	And there she was. Blair. Standing in the doorway to the bedroom that was once his. Before he’d moved out four years ago to escape the memories they&rsquo;d formed together, living in the city fresh out of college. Her brunette hair was still as long as the last day he’d seen it — she had always maintained it so meticulously, always trimmed to just the length she liked it, the ends of each strand of hair connecting gracefully with her shoulders — and her face shined with the huge grin that had once blinded him every time he arrived home, no matter how long he’d been gone. Peering into the room behind her, he could see it was as messy as always, clothing discarded on the floor and at least a week&rsquo;s worth of used plates stacked at the base of her desk. He slowly leaned back and slid down against the living room wall, coming to a rest in an almost kneeling position, his legs bent forward and all his weight focused on his toes. It was uncomfortable. He didn’t care.</p>
<hr>
<p>The length of the shadows on the floor, the oranges and burnt yellows of the light seeping through the window blinds, the honking of cars stuck in rush hour traffic, all told Henry that it was now sunset. What time did he get to the apartment? How long had he been sitting here?</p>
<p>Without warning, the front door of the apartment swung open and in walked an older man of what must have been at least twice Henry’s age. The man didn’t notice him at first. He whistled a light, yet somber tune. “Somewhere Over the Rainbow,” Henry guessed. He took off his hat, revealing a thin tuft of grey hair, and placed it on a low table — also sandalwood, to stay consistent with the landlord&rsquo;s chosen, drab interior theme — near the doorway. His eyes met Henry’s when he was halfway to the open bedroom door. After a moment to size him up, the man crossed his arms and leaned back against the kitchen counter.</p>
<p>“So you’re the real thing.”</p>
<p>Henry jumped slightly at the question, taken by surprise. That wasn&rsquo;t what he expected the man&rsquo;s first thought would be. “Yeah, you could say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“I was wondering if you’d ever track yourself down here.”</p>
<p>The man pointed towards Other Henry, fast asleep on the couch. He’d fallen asleep a half hour after they’d gotten in that morning, and hadn’t woken up since. Henry hated naps. There was no more surefire way to squander a day.</p>
<p>“When’d you get here?”</p>
<p>“I honestly don’t remember. Sometime in the morning.”</p>
<p>The man nodded. “It was the same way for me when I found myself. Lost my sense of everything.” He ran a hand over his clean shaven chin. “You must need a drink, yeah?”</p>
<p>“Sure. Might as well.”</p>
<p>The man walked into the kitchen, pulled out two short tumblers, and poured in healthy amounts of — from what Henry could make out on the bottle — some 1932 or 37 Spanish gin. He motioned to the reclining chairs opposite the couch, and handed Henry his glass once they were seated.</p>
<p>“My father gave me this as a gift after I got back from my tour in Iraq. I was saving it for a special occasion, you know how it goes.” After a short, wheezing chuckle, he continued. “Thought I’d have all the time in the world for one to come.”</p>
<p>Henry raised the glass in a solemn toast and took a drink. It was thick and tasted strong and earthy. Like how he imagined tree bark would taste.</p>
<p>“So, how’s it felt? Watching yourself?”</p>
<p>Henry squirmed slightly in his seat as the man eyed him. “Odd. It’s felt odd.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s only natural.” He paused. “What do you make of this mess?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know. None of the explanations I’ve heard make any sense.”</p>
<p>The old man grunted. “I hear that. Well, as for me, I think this is all God&rsquo;s way of punishing us.” He set the glass down on the table, the drink still untouched, and folded his arms in his lap. “And what a punishment it is, don&rsquo;t you think?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Maybe.”</p>
<p>“Are you a man of Christ?”</p>
<p>“I don&rsquo;t know.” Henry fidgeted with his shoelaces. “I used to be a man of science. But all this stuff has really shaken my faith.”</p>
<p>The old man nodded. “That’s to be expected. Nothing really makes sense anymore. But, it’s nice to think this is all part of His plan. At least, it is for me. And we all need something to keep us going.”</p>
<p>Henry gave the man a furlorn glance. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re really still a believer? Even with all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah. I am. He was able to make this world. Is it that crazy to think He also made that one, too? I never understood the fuss everyone made about it when this started. &lsquo;This disproves the existence of God,&rsquo; my ass. If anything this should have made all of our convictions even stronger. Look, His creation of our world wasn&rsquo;t a fluke! He made multiple! That&rsquo;s the proper response, I think. Not all that rioting. Not all the suiciding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, he rose from his chair.“Sorry to cut this short, but I’m heading back out for the evening. Got a prior engagement. I&rsquo;ll tell you, there was one nice thing about everyone thinking they were about to get annihilated any minute&hellip; No one dragged your ass to awkward dinners!&rdquo; He wheezed. &ldquo;Now that they think maybe we&rsquo;ve got some time left after all, everyone&rsquo;s <em>so</em> eager to catch up again.&rdquo; After a quick shake of his head, he glanced at Henry. &ldquo;Stay as long as you need.”</p>
<hr>
<p>Almost a half hour after the man&rsquo;s departure, Blair emerged from the bedroom, where she had spent the day working on her writing, as she had always done, each day and each night. Henry guessed she was still working on the novel she&rsquo;d started a few months after they&rsquo;d first moved into that apartment. Her sixth or seventh draft by now, no doubt, her perfectionism her greatest foe. And now, done with the day&rsquo;s work, her eyes stared down at his Other with the look he’d once longed for, a look she had withheld from him for some time towards the end. Seeing that look told Henry all he needed to know. And as she roused his Other from his sleep, Henry’s vision blurred and he felt the sting of salt on his cheeks, a sting he hadn&rsquo;t felt in years.	He knew that the man before him, now awake and smiling up at Blair, was a man who would never lay a hand on the person he loves. Who would never get aggressive with them after an argument out at a bar, late at night, walking down the poorly lit sidewalk. He would never say all those terrible things before pushing them away, harder than intended, further than planned. Out into the street and in front of the approaching truck. And even then, he would own up to his crime. He surely wouldn&rsquo;t use his connections on the force to shield him from the consequences.</p>
<p>Henry rose from the chair and sprinted out the door, away from Blair and away from the life that could have been his. If he were someone else. If he were his Other.</p>
